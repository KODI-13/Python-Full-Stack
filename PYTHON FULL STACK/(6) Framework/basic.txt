pip = is a python package manager use to instll neccessary packges

# how to install django
          check the packges list using "pip list" command
step 1 == install virtual environment using """pip install env""" command

step 2 == we have to create virtual environment folder using """py -m venv folder_name""" command

step 3 ==  after creeating virtual environment you have to activate the virtual environment 
           for these you have to go in cmd and using commands you have to go inside in the Scripts folder and reach to  activate file
           e.g
            """folder_name\Scripts\activate.bat"""  

step 4 == you have to download django using """pip install django""" command
          we can intstall this in virtual environment or in entire system
          we must have to activate venv before intall django

step 5 == we have to project folder with the help of django-admin using 
            """django-admin startproject myproject"""
            "django-admin" command gives the sub-command of django (*NOTE = if you don't know the commands of django)

step 6 == after creating myproject we have to create myapp in the myproject folder with the help of python manager.py 
         to access mange.py first we need to change directory and enter to myproject folder 
         to do this use following command 
         """cd myproject"""

step 7 == after changing directory we will create myapp in the myproject folder with the help of python manager.py  using following command
            """py manage.py startapp myapp"""

step 8 == to check if our project is created successfully or not we will wse following command
            """py manage.py runserver"""

          for that follow the following path
          myproject --> settings.py --> line no 33...write yoour application name in the INSTALLED_APPS

step 2 == in myproject there is urls.py file where you can create url of your webs using path function
                path("url_name/",the function name which will we get when the url_name is called )
          in myapp there is view.py file where we create functions which will linked to a specicific url_name 
          (*NOTE = These function in views.py get request from user and response as html pages, etc )

step 1 == you can create table inside models.py file 
         for that you have to create a class and inherit it with a Model class
         and you write field inside the class you have created
        after creating fields you have to make migratins using following command 
        """py manage.py makemigrations"""
